    <h1 class="colored">Lists</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>Lists allow you to work with a collection of items and easily store a large amount of data. Let's say we want to represent the temperatures in a week. Rather than creating 7 separate variables for each of the temperatures, we make a list to contain all 7 of them. A list is enclosed by square brackets, and the items of the list are separated by commas.</p>

    <pre class="code">
temperatures = [33, 32, 32, 34, 35, 32, 31, 31]
print(temperatures)</pre>
    <pre class="out">[33, 32, 32, 34, 35, 32, 31, 31]</pre>

    <p>You can similarly make a list of strings, as in <code>weather = ['cloudy', 'rainy', 'cloudy', 'sunny', 'sunny', 'rainy', 'thunderstorms']</code>. You can also make an emtpy list using a pair of brackets with nothing between them.</p>

    <p>Using <code>.append()</code>, you can grow the list by adding elements to the end of the list.</p>

    <pre class="code">
fruits = ['watermelons', 'kiwis', 'cherries']
fruits.append('blueberries')
print(fruits)
fruits.append('pears')
fruits.append('strawberries')
print(fruits)</pre>
    <pre class="out">
['watermelons', 'kiwis', 'cherries', 'blueberries']
['watermelons', 'kiwis', 'cherries', 'blueberries', 'pears', 'strawberries']</pre>

    <p>You can access specific elements from a list by using its index, or position in the list. Index numbers start at 0 in Python, which means the very first element in a list is index 0. If the list is <code>fruits = ['watermelons', 'kiwis', 'cherries']</code>, then <code>fruits[0]</code> refers to <code>'watermelons'</code>, <code>fruits[1]</code> refers to <code>'kiwis'</code>, and <code>fruits[2]</code> refers to <code>'cherries'</code>. Note how element <code>[2]</code> is the last element in a list with 3 things in it (because the first one is <code>[0]</code>).</p>
    <p>If you try to access an element that is outside of a list's bounds (e.g., if the list has 5 elements and you try to grab index <code>[10]</code>), Python will give an error.</p>

    <pre class="code">
fruits = ['watermelons', 'kiwis', 'cherries']
print(fruits[1])
fruits[1] = 'bananas'
print(fruits)</pre>
    <pre class="out">
kiwis
['watermelons', 'bananas', 'cherries']</pre>

    <div class="indent">
      <p>Try:<br />
	Make a list that contains the first 8 prime numbers, then print out the list.<br />
	Create a list called <code>apps</code> and initialize it with "contacts", "photos", "calendar", "news", and "mail". Then, use <code>.append()</code> to add "stocks" and "notes" to the list. Print out the final list.<br />
	Using the <code>apps</code> list from the previous exercise, print out the 5th element in the list (index 4). Then, print out "calendar" using the corresponding index.<br />
	Change the "notes" element from the <code>apps</code> list to be "reminders" instead.</p>
    </div>

    <hr />
    <h2 class="colored">Slicing</h2>

    <p>Python also allows you to get a particular part of a list, described by a starting index and an ending index. "Slicing" a list gives you a new list containing only the specified part.</p>

    <pre class="code">
fruits = ['watermelons', 'kiwis', 'cherries', 'blueberries', 'pears', 'strawberries']
some_fruits = fruits[1:4]
print(some_fruits)</pre>
    <pre class="out">['kiwis', 'cherries', 'blueberries']</pre>

    <p>In the example above, the slice starts at index 1 ("kiwis") and ends right before index 4 ("pears"), and contains 4 - 1 = 3 elements (specifically, positions 1, 2, and 3). Note that the starting index is included in the slice while the ending index is excluded. As another example, <code>fruits[2:6]</code> would contain 6 - 2 = 4 elements (2, 3, 4, and 5), from "cherries" to "strawberries".</p>

    <p>You can omit the starting or ending index (or even both). If the start is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (slice from the beginning of the list). If the end is omitted, it is assumed to be the length of the list (slice until the end). Thus, if both are omitted, the slice contains the entire list, essentially making a copy of the original.</p>

    <p>Use the <code>len()</code> function to find the length of a list. The same function also works on strings (in which case it returns the number of characters in the string).</p>

    <pre class="code">
fruits = ['watermelons', 'kiwis', 'cherries', 'blueberries', 'pears', 'strawberries']
print(len(fruits))
print(len('hello there'))</pre>
    <pre class="out">
6
11</pre>

    <div class="indent">
      <p>Try:<br />
	Create a list of the first Fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21), and print out a slice of it that contains only the ones that are less than 10.<br />
	Using the Fibonacci list from before, print another slice that contains 2, 3, 5, and 8.<br />
	Print the length of the Fibonacci list.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="colored">Lists and Loops</h2>

    <p>Loops naturally go with lists, allowing you to repeat an operation on all the elements. We may need to loop over an entire list to do something to each of the things in it. Both for and while loops can be used to do this, but a for loop is usually more convenient.</p>

    <p>The code below shows the two most typical ways to loop through a list.</p>
    
    <pre class="code">
colors = ['yellow', 'orange', 'red', 'violet', 'blue', 'green']
print('Method 1:')      
for x in colors:
    print(x)
print('Method 2:')
for i in range(len(colors)):
    print(colors[i])</pre>
    <pre class="out">
Method 1:
yellow
orange
red
violet
blue
green
Method 2:
yellow
orange
red
violet
blue
green</pre>

    <p>Let's first look at the first method. Recall that a for loop follows the format of "<code>for <span class="light">item</span> in <span class="light">collection_of_items</span></code>". Here, because there are 6 elements in the list <code>colors</code>, the loop repeats for 6 times. Each time through the loop, the variable <code>x</code> takes on the value of the next element in the list.</p>
    <p>In method 2, you can pretend the loop is "<code>for i in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>" because <code>len(colors)</code> is 6, and <code>range(6)</code> gives you the numbers 0 through 5. Thus, the first time through the loop, <code>i</code> is 0, and printing <code>colors[i]</code> gives <code>colors[0]</code> ("yellow"). The second time through, <code>i</code> is 1, therefore <code>colors[1]</code> is printed out, and so on.</p>

    <pre class="code">
deck = ['king of diamonds', '8 of spades', 'ace of clubs', '7 of hearts']
for card in deck:
    print('Press enter to draw a card.')
    input()
    print(card)
    print('---------------------------')</pre>
    <pre class="out">
Press enter to draw a card.

king of diamonds
---------------------------
Press enter to draw a card.

8 of spades
---------------------------
Press enter to draw a card.

ace of clubs
---------------------------
Press enter to draw a card.

7 of hearts
---------------------------</pre>

    <p>The next program finds the largest number in the list <code>nums</code> (achieving the effect of <code>max(nums)</code> essentially).</p>

    <pre class="code">
nums = [3, 5, 2, 4, 9, 7, 1]
largest = nums[0]
for n in nums:
    if n &gt; largest:
        largest = n
print(largest)</pre>
    <pre class="out">9</pre>

    <p>It is also very common to use a for loop with <code>range()</code> to iterate through a list. Let's modify the program above so we also print out what index the maximum element is located at.</p>

    <pre class="code">
nums = [3, 5, 2, 4, 9, 7, 1]
largest = nums[0]
largest_pos = 0
for i in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[i] &gt; largest:
        largest = nums[i]
        largest_pos = i
print(largest, 'at index', largest_pos)</pre>
    <pre class="out">9 at index 4</pre>

    <p>This final example performs bubble sort on a list of numbers to organize them in ascending order. The idea is that you look at each element in the list and compare that element to all the elements that come after it. If the one that comes after is smaller, these two are out of order and should be swapped.</p>

    <pre class="code">
nums = [3, 5, 2, 4, 9, 7, 1]
for i in range(len(nums)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] &lt; nums[i]:
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
print(nums)</pre>
    <pre class="out">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]</pre>

    <p>On line 3, we gave <code>range()</code> two numbers instead of the usual one. Like list slicing, <code>range()</code> with two numbers specify where to start and stop. In this example, we start at one after whatever value <code>i</code> currently is and stop right before 7 (the length of the list). Therefore, if <code>i</code> is currently 3, then <code>j</code> takes on the values 4, 5, and 6 (referring to all the elements that come after <code>num[3]</code>).</p>

    <div class="indent">
      <p>Try:<br />
	Make a list of 10 numbers of your choosing. Then use a loop to double each of them.<br />
	Use another loop to find the sum of the 10 numbers in your list from the previous exercise.<br />
	Make a list of 10 different numbers, then ask the user to input a number to search for. Use a loop to find the index of this number in the list.<br />
	Write a phone book program (<a href="phonebook.txt" target="_blank">example</a>).<br />
	Write a one-dimensional minesweeper game (<a href="minesweeper.txt" target="_blank">example</a>).<br />
	Write a tic tac toe game (<a href="tictactoe.txt" target="_blank">example</a>). You can use a list of lists to represent the board state: <code>board = [[' ', 'X', 'O'], ['X', 'X', 'O'], [' ', 'O', ' ']]</code> with each of the inside lists representing a row on the board. Use double indices to reference the individual spots, as in <code>board[1][1]</code> (the middle spot).</p>
